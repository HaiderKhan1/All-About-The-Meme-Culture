    How Memes Infulence Our Daily Lives
</font> </h1>

<p style="font-family: Parkavenue; font-size:1.75vw;">
  Memes have existed for centuries in local communities across the world; however,
  memes undertook significant evolution with the introduction of the internet in
  the 1990s, as it unified people across the globe. Furthermore, in today's age memes
  are extremely popular amongst the younger people (Generation Z, millennials), and
  I can personally confirm this as I belong to the Generation Z age group. Moreover,
  memes have changed many aspects of the daily lives of the younger people as it provides
  us with a gateway to connect with millions of people around the world. Thus, memes are
  typically used as a tool for social connections, as people start conversations by simply
  sharing a meme, engage in the comment sections of the vast social media apps and more
  importantly have a little laugh while doing so. Additionally, memes have also influenced
  how people interact with each other over text or in real life sometimes; for example,
  people in the Generation Z and millennial age group mainly text using meme slags such as
  LOL (Laugh out loud), WTH (What the heck) and GTHO (Get the heck out), these are just
  to name a few of the millions of meme abbreviations. Not only that, memes are an excellent
  form of entertainment as they cover a wide range of mediums and genres at absolutely no cost.
  Therefore, they have become a way for us to unwind, have a little laugh, pass time and stay entertained
  as we browse through the endless array of memes that can easily be found on the web.
