  If you were to google the definition of a meme you would get something along the lines of,
  “A meme is a concept or behavior that spreads from person to person”. However, the outright
  definition of a meme is hard to nail. Due to the fact, that a meme could be anything that is
  portrayed through a photo or a video, that portrays a context or message of some sort, and
  oftentimes the purpose of a meme is purely meant for humor. Moreover, chances are that you
  have come across numerous memes throughout your lifetime, you probably didn’t recognize it;
  for example, the ice bucket challenge, or a “Keep Calm” mug and t-shirt are just some of the
  variations of the vast meme culture. Not only that, but the meme culture is also abundantly
  established on the internet, as millions of memes are made each day from users all over the
  world and published to social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and TicTock and
  these are just to name a few of the thousands of different social networking apps out there.
